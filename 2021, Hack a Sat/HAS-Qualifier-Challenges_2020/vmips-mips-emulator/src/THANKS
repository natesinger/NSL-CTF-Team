 Conversations I had with Michael Constant <mconst at csua.berkeley.edu>
 provided me with the initial impetus for writing the emulator.
 My experience in Computer Science 61C at UC Berkeley helped to reinforce
 my convictions in the matter. ;-)

 I looked to James Larus's <larus at microsoft.com> SPIM simulator, to
 which I have also been a code contributor, for examples of what to do
 (and sometimes, what not to do) when faced with certain tricky issues.

 Galen Hancock <galen at csua.berkeley.edu> has provided some patches.

 Paul Twohey <twohey at csua.berkeley.edu> has provided several major patches,
 and has generously tested new versions of VMIPS as they are released,
 on various architectures. He has filed many insightful bug reports and
 also provided MIPS tools for Mac OS X.

 Steve Tu <sktu at ocf.berkeley.edu> contributed a rewrite of the CPU core
 inner loop.

 Sanjeev Datla <sanjeev_datla at hotmail.com> has done some testing and
 contributed fixes for TLB bugs.

 Chen Mingyu <cmy at ict.ac.cn> found two bugs in the TLB emulation.

 Vladimir Machulsky <bofhmail at yahoo.com> found a bug in the debugger
 interface.

 Thanks to everyone else who has gotten in touch with me over the years
 about their experiences using VMIPS.  Your feedback makes a difference!
