Kubos SDK Docs
==============

While the majority of KubOS development can be done locally on a host machine, we also provide a
standalone SDK which can be used to assist with the development process.

The "Kubos SDK" is a term used to describe all of the components used
to build KubOS projects:

-  `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`__ box - The VM that contains the "ready to run" Kubos development
   environment
-  Kubos source modules - The underlying libraries on which KubOS projects
   are built

Internally, we use this SDK in order to build KubOS releases and to host our CI tests.

Externally, the SDK is most useful for:

- Windows users
- Users who do not want to muddle their host systems with all of the dependencies required to build
  and execute KubOS projects
- Users who want to build a :ref:`custom KubOS image <custom-klb>`
