Introduction to pi3d
====================

pi3d is a Python module that aims to greatly simplify writing 3D in Python
whilst giving access to the power of the Raspberry Pi GPU. It enables both
3D and 2D rendering and aims to provide a host of exciting commands to load
in textured/animated models, create fractal landscapes, shaders and much more.

The pi3d module runs on platforms other than the Raspberry Pi (On Windows
using pygame, on linux using the X server directly and on Android using
python-for-android) and runs with python 3 as well as 2.
The OpenGLES2.0 functionality of the Raspberry Pi or Android is used directly
or via mesa or ANGLE on 'big' machines. This makes it generally *faster*
and opens up the world of *shaders* that allow effects such as normal and 
reflection maps, blurring and many others. It has various demos of built-in
shapes, landscapes, model loading, walk-about camera and much more! See the demos
on github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos and experiment with them ..
