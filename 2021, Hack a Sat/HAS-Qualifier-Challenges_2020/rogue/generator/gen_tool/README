Usage: <output wav file> <string to send> <first packet start time (ns)> <delay between packets (ns)> <number of packets> <signal power> <noise power> <seed string>

Jason should write more but here goes:

<output wav file> : Output file to write the created wav file to
<string to send> : A string to include inside the output signal (which is a 2400 baud FSK waveform)
<first packet start time> : The start time of the first packet to begin sending (in nanoseconds)
<delay between packets> : This time will be used to delay between sending the next packet (same as previous), essentialy the gap between transmissions
<number of packets> : This is the number of packets to include in the output file, repeated this many times
<signal power> : An absolute amplitude of the signal power, value should be from 0->32767 (signed uint16 max)
<noise power> : An absolute amplitude of the noise power, value should be from 0->32767 (signed uint16 max)
<seed string> : This argument will seed the random number generator which is used to generate the AWGN noise
