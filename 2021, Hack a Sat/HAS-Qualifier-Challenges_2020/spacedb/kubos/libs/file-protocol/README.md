# File Transfer Protocol

This protocol uses a content-addressable methodology similar to Git for storing and
chunking files.
It facilitates reliable file transfer in an asynchronous and error-prone environment.

The file transfer protocol is used by both the file transfer service and
clients interacting with the service.
