# Quals Challenge: Leaky Crypto #

**Category:** Payload Modules
**Relative Difficulty:** 4/5
**Author:** [Cromulence](https://cromulence.com/)

My crypto algorithm runs in constant time, so I'm safe from
side-channel leaks, right?

Note: To clarify, the sample data is plaintext inputs, NOT ciphertext.


## Building ##

This repository contains two Docker images: The `generator` and `solver`.
You can build them both with:

```sh
make build
```

The resulting Docker images will be tagged as `leaky:generator`
and `leaky:solver`.

You can also build just one of them with `make generator` or `make solver`
respectively.

Building the `generator` container requires having already built the
`generator-base` container (see the `generator-base` folder).


## Deploying ##

This challenge has nothing to deploy. It's self-contained within the files
generated by the `generator`. See the top-level `README.md` for more
information on using the `generator` container.


## Testing ##

See top-level `README.md` file for more information on using the `solver`
container.
