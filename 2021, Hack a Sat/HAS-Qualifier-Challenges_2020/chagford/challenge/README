This challenge is primarily a RE challenge and a simple crypto exploit. Symbols were removed to increase difficulty but
can be added back in without trivializing the challenge.
The challenge tries to give bread crumbs of the protocol with the PCAP and it can also be used to perform a trivial 
replay attack and a AES-CTR byte swap attack to change the system to the "undocumented" DEBUG mode that allows encryption
to be disabled.
