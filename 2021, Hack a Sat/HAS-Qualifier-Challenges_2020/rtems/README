$ git clone <url/to/rtems.git>
$ cd rtems
$ git submodule update --init 

Optional: If you want to build tools that incorporate an unaligned memory access instruction emulator as 
a trap handler, include the following patch

$ cd rtems5-base/rtems
$ git am < ../0001-Added-Mem-Unaligned-Trap-handler.patch

Building the following code takes a lot of time, but should only need to be built once. It is recommended
that one machine build the image, and export it to the rest of the team using docker image save/load

$ make rtems5-base

Next, to build both i386 and SPARC gcc tool chains in one container (recommended, required for cFS)

$ make rtems5-tools

Alternatively to only build the SPARC gcc tool chains (NOT recommended, doesn't support later steps)

$ make rtems5-tools-sparc

To build additional tools for flashing the boards (do to evaluation license, we cannot distribute this!)

$ make has_tools

To add useful bash functions to your shell, source the board-tools/env.sh in your bashrc

NOTE: This entire process takes a long time, and only the final has_tools is likely to be required 
for most people. This file has been cached and is readily available on our internal file share.
