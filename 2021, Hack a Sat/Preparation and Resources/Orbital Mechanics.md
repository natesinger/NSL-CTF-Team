# Orbital Mechanics
8 days to competition, hope everyone is getting ready and is excited to compete! I'm going to be posting these educational posts once a day until competition and if anyone else wants to contribute a post that would be cool too. Hopefully this helps someone. The basic idea is to post about things that will be relevant to the comp, and so today I'm starting with a basic to advanced learning cycle for orbital mechanics. I think its important that we identify common protocols and libraries as well, so that could be something I'd like help with. Remember, this is a weird CTF and this is more about thinking outside the box than "I know ret2libc," or "<script>alert(1)..."

Here is just under an hour of material. If you can spend some time in KSP it will drastically help, but these videos are organized in a progressive manner and should be enough on their own. If you have an hour I'd recommend queuing them up and watching them in order.
